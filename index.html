        This specification refines the semantics and interaction patterns of [[!LDP]] in order to better serve the specific needs of those interested in implementing or using the Fedora information architecture. Additionally, this specification contains:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>a reconciliation of [[LDP]] and the well-established version identification and navigation scheme delineated in the [[!RFC7089]] specification,</li>
		<li>interaction patterns for use with binary fixity information,</li>
		<li>a scheme for assembling multiple operations against an [[LDP]] server into one atomic operation,</li>
		<li>integration with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">Web Access Control proposal,</a></li>

			<section id="general">
			  <h2>General</h2>
				<p>If a <code>Link: rel="type"</code> header specifies an LDP-NR interaction model (<code>ldp:NonRDFSource</code>), then the server SHOULD handle subsequent requests to the newly created resource as if it is a LDP-NR. ([[LDP]] 5.2.3.4 extension)
				<section id="LDPC">
				  <h2>LDP Containers</h2>
				  <p>Implementations MUST support the creation and management of [[LDP]] Containers. LDP Direct Containers MUST NOT permit <code>ldp:contains</code> as their membership-predicate and requests that would so do MUST fail with 409 Conflict. ([[LDP]] 5.4.1.4 expansion) </p>
			  </section>
				<section id="message-external-body">
				  <h2>Content-Type: message/external-body</h2>
				  <p>Implementations MUST support the use of <code>Content-Type: message/external-body</code> for request bodies for HTTP <code>POST</code> and HTTP <code>PUT</code> to LDP-NRs. This content-type requires a complete <code>Content-Type</code> header that includes the location of the external body, e.g <pre>Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL; URL=\"http://www.example.com/file\"</pre> When a GET is made to the resource in question, the response MUST be an HTTP 3xx redirect message redirecting to the external URL.</p>

				<h2>HTTP PATCH</h2>
				<p>
					Any LDPRS MUST support PATCH ([[LDP]] 4.2.7 MAY becomes MUST). [[!sparql11-update]] MUST be an accepted content-type for PATCH. Other content-types (e.g. [ldpatch]) MAY be available. If an otherwise valid HTTP PATCH request is received that attempts to add statements to a resource that a server disallows (not ignores per [[!LDP]] 4.2.4.1), the server MUST fail the request by responding with a 4xx range status code (e.g. 409 Conflict). The server MUST provide a corresponding response body containing information about which statements could not be persisted. ([[LDP]] 4.2.4.4 SHOULD becomes MUST). In that response the restrictions causing such a request to fail MUST be described in a resource indicated by a <code>Link@rel="ldp:constrainedBy"</code> response header per [[LDP]] 4.2.1.6. A successful PATCH request MUST respond with a 2xx status code; the specific code in the 2xx range MAY vary according to the response body or request state.

The default interaction model that will be assigned when there is no explicit Link header in the request MUST be recorded in the constraints document referenced in the <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code> Link header ([[LDP]] 4.2.1.6 clarification). Any LDPC MUST support creation of LDP-NRs on POST (LDP 5.2.3.3 MAY becomes MUST). On creation of an LDP-NR an implementation MUST create an associated LDP-RS describing that LDP-NR ([[LDP]] 5.2.3.12 MAY becomes MUST).

If that type is a value in the LDP namespace and is not either a current type of the resource or a subtype of a current type of the resource, the request MUST be rejected with a 409 Conflict response containing a corresponding explanatory message in the response body. If the type in the Link header is a subtype of a current type of the resource, and has an interaction model assigned to it by [[LDP]], then the resource MUST be assigned the new type and the interaction model of the resource MUST be changed to the interaction model assigned to the new type by [[LDP]].

If an otherwise valid HTTP PUT request is received that attempts to add statements to a resource that a server disallows (not ignores per [[LDP]] 4.2.4.1), the server MUST fail the request by responding with a 4xx range status code (e.g. 409 Conflict).

        <p>
          When a <a>LDPR</a> is created with a <code>Link</code> header indicating versioning, it is created as both an LDP Resource and a Memento: a <a>LDPRm</a>. An <a>LDPRm</a> SHOULD be invariant: While it may be deleted, it SHOULD NOT be modified once created.

      <section>
        <h2>HTTP GET</h2>
        <p>
          An implementation MUST support <code>GET</code>, as is the case for any <a>LDPR</a>. The headers for <code>GET</code> requests and responses on this resource must conform to [[!RFC7089]].

      <h2>Version Containers (<a>LDPCv</a>)</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
When a <a>LDPR</a> is created with a <code>Link</code> header indicating versioning, a version container (<a>LDPCv</a>) is created that contains Memento-identified resources (<a>LDPRm</a>) capturing time-varying states of the associated <a>LDPR</a>. The <a>LDPCv</a> is both a <a>TimeMap</a> per [[!RFC7089]] (Memento) and an LDP Container. An implementation MUST indicate <a>TimeMap</a> in the same way it indicates the Container interaction model of the resource (e.g. via HTTP headers or inserted <code>rdf:type</code>). An <a>LDPCv</a> MUST respond to <code>GET Accept: application/link-format</code> as indicated in [[!RFC7089]] <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089#section-5'>section 5</a> and specified in [[RFC6690]] <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690#section-7.3'>section 7.3</a>.
        </p>
		<p>
		An implementation MUST NOT allow any <a>LDPCv</a> to be LDP-contained by its associated <a>LDPRv</a>.
		</p>
        <p>
Non-normative: The <code>application/link-format</code> representation of a <a>LDPCv</a> is not required to include all statements in the <a>LDPCv</a> graph, only those required by <a>TimeMap</a> behaviors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id='ldpcvdelete'>HTTP DELETE</h2>
        <p>
An implementation MAY support <code>DELETE</code>. An implementation that does support <code>DELETE</code> SHOULD do so by both removing the <a>LDPCv</a> and removing the versioning interaction model from the original <a>LDPRv</a>.
        </p>

        </section>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>HTTP OPTIONS</h2>
        <p>
An implementation MUST <code>Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS</code> as per [[!LDP]]. An implementation MAY <code>Allow: DELETE</code> if the versioning behavior is removable by deleting the <a>LDPCv</a>. See <a href='#ldpcvdelete'></a> for requirements on DELETE if supported.
An implementation MAY <code>Allow: PATCH</code> if the <a>LDPCv</a> has mutable properties. See <a href='#ldpcvpatch'></a> for requirements on <code>PATCH</code> if supported.
An implementation MAY <code>Allow: POST</code> if versions can be explicitly minted by a client. See <a href='#ldpcvpost'></a> for requirements on <code>POST</code> if supported.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id='ldpcvpatch'>HTTP PATCH</h2>
        <p>
An implementation MAY <code>Allow: PATCH</code>, but if so, it MUST NOT permit clients to modify containment triples.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id='ldpcvpost'>HTTP POST</h2>
        <p>
OPTIONAL. If a <a>LDPCv</a> Allow: POST, POST should be understood to create a new <a>LDPRm</a> contained by the <a>LDPCv</a>, reflecting the state of the <a>LDPRv</a> at the time of the POST. If supported, and all <a>LDPRm</a> statements are server-managed, Accept-Post SHOULD indicate that no request body is accepted ("Accept-Post: */*; p=0.0" has minimal conflict with LDP), and POST with a request body SHOULD respond with 4xx and a link to an appropriate constraints document (see <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#h-ldpr-gen-pubclireqs'>LDP 4.2.1.6</a>). As per LDP, any resource created via POST, in this case a <a>LDPRm</a>) should be advertised in the response's Location header.
        </p>
        <p>
If a <a>LDPCv</a> accepts POST with a request body, it SHOULD respect a Memento-Datetime request header to mint the <a>URI-M</a>. Absent this header, it MUST use the current time.          
        </p>
        <p>
Non-normative note: If <a>LDPCv</a> implementations do not <code>Allow: POST</code>, the constraints document indicated in <code>Link@rel="constrainedby"</code> for the <a>LDPCv</a> should describe the versioning mechanism. Disallowing POST suggests that the [[LDP]] server will manage all <a>LDPRm</a> creation; see <a href ="#server-managed">here</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HTTP PUT</h2>
        <p>
OPTIONAL. If an implementation accepts PUT, it SHOULD reject created URIs that are not <a>URI-M</a>. It MUST respond to rejected request bodies as specified in LDP. <a>LDPCv</a> MUST reflect the range of times indicated by contained <a>LDPRm</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Non-normative: An implementation that accepts PUT is not required to validate content.
        </p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class='informative'>Vary-Post/Vary-Put</h2>
      <p>
When Post/Put to a resource optionally mints an identified version, the resource indicates it with Vary-Post/Vary-Put with the name of the request header indicating it. When a <a>LDPCv</a> supports Post/Put with a body, and allows client-specification of <a>URI-M</a> datetime, Vary-Post/Vary-Put: Memento-Datetime.

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
This is a non-normative section describing the way the normative specification might be applied to implement discoverable versioning patterns. If an implementation of a <a>LDPCv</a> does not support POST to mint versions, that MUST be advertised via <code>OPTIONS</code>. Presumably the implementation would automatically mint versions, but that is outside this specification. This document specifies normatively only how <a>LDPCv</a>s and <a>LDPRm</a>s can be discovered, and how they should act.

        <h2><a>LDPRm</a> Creation Patterns</h2>
        <section id="server-managed">
          <h2>Server-Managed Version Creation</h2>
          <p>
Upon <code>PUT/PATCH</code> to the <a>LDPRv</a>, a new <a>LDPRm</a> is created in an appropriate <a>LDPCv</a>. This <a>LDPRm</a>/<a>URI-M</a> is the version of the original <a>LDPR</a>/<a>URI-R</a> that was just created.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Client-Managed Version Creation</h2>
          <p>
A <a>LDPRm</a> is created on <code>POST</code> to some <a>LDPCv</a>, <i>with an entity body</i>.  This pattern is more open to manipulation and could be useful for migration from other systems into Fedora Versioning systems.
          <p>
Responses from <code>GET</code> requests to the <a>LDPR</a>/<a>URI-R</a> include a <code>Link@rel=‚Äôversion-history‚Äô</code> pointing to the <a>LDPCv</a> as well as a <code>Link@rel="timemap"</code> to the same <a>LDPCv</a>.
          </p>

      <section>
        <h2>LDP Considerations</h2>
        <p>
Advertising default behaviors in server constraints document
        </p>
        <p>
If the [[LDP]] server allows reuse of URIs after deletion
Does this undermine the meaning of the version history?          
        </p>
        <p>
<a>LDPCv</a> as a DirectContainer
Minimizing header inspection for read-only clients with http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasVersion or similar.          
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Memento Considerations</h2>
        <p>
If the <a>LDPCv</a>/<a>TimeMap</a> is also the <a>TimeGate</a> Responses from <code>GET</code> requests to the version container (<a>LDPCv</a>) will vary depending on the presence or absence of an Accept-Datetime header in the request.
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the absence of an Accept-Datetime header, the response will be an appropriately constructed <a>TimeMap</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the presence of  an Accept-Datetime header, the response will be a redirect to the appropriately chosen <a>LDPRm</a>/<a>URI-M</a>, i.e. the version container will behave like a <a>TimeGate</a>.
            </li>
          <ul>

    <section id="resource-authorization">
      <h2>Resource Authorization</h2>
			<p>Implementations supporting access control MUST use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">Web Access Control</a> model to configure that functionality. Any <a>ACL</a> in use MUST be a LDPRS, which SHOULD be located in the same server as the controlled resource. Implementations MUST support extended control relationships in which the <a>ACL</a> for some resource has its own <a>ACL</a> and so on.</p>
  	  <section id="inheritance">
	    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
		<p>An implementation MUST respect [[!LDP]]-containment for access control, such that an authorization rule applied to an [[!LDP]] container will also apply to that container's contents. When some contained resource has its own access control configuration that applies to a given interaction that configuration MUST be respected.</p>
